# CaféMP – Experimental Media Player for the Nintendo Wii U

## 🎬 About

**CaféMP** is a lightweight, open-source media player for the Wii U, focused on basic media playback from the SD card. It supports most common video and audio formats, targeting up to **720p at 30 FPS**.

This is a **work-in-progress**—expect occasional crashes, stutters, or other instability. I'm not a specialist in FFmpeg, Wii U homebrew, or C++.

Made with ❤️ in 🇩🇪

> ⚠️ **Note:** 720p30 is the *goal*, not a guarantee. Playback performance depends on encoding complexity.

## 🐞 Known Issues

* ❗ **Audio/Video Desync**
  Playback may fall out of sync, especially with high-resolution or complex video files. Re-encoding with the recommended FFmpeg settings may help.

* ❗ **App Crashes on Exit**
  In some cases, the application may crash or freeze when returning to the Wii U system menu.

* ❗ **Unstable / Experimental Behavior**
  CaféMP is in early development. Expect occasional hangs, crashes, or features not working as intended.

* ❗ **GamePad Required**
  Currently, the app cannot be used without the Wii U GamePad. Other input methods like Pro Controller or Wiimote are not supported yet.

* ❗ **Limited MKV Support**
  Not all `.mkv` files will work. Only those encoded with **H.264 video** and compatible audio formats are expected to play properly.

* ❗ **Inconsistent FLAC Support**
  Some `.flac` audio files play fine, while others may fail to load or crash the app. This is due to partial support in the current audio pipeline.
